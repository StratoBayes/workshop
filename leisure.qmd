Durham is famous for its mighty cathedral, which forms part of the Durham Castle and Cathedral World Heritage Site. The cathedral can be visited throughout the day, and the cathedral tower ([booking required](https://www.durhamcathedral.co.uk/visit-us/things-to-see-and-do/tours-experiences)) offers a spectacular view. The historic city centre with its picturesque bridges and forested riverbanks invites for a stroll. Durham University is home to 20,000 students, contributing to a lively ambiance in the town's many bars and cafes.

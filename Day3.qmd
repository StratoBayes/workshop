If you don't have a dataset you would like to work with, you can use a carbon isotope data set with radiometric dates from Morocco and Siberia. The spreadsheets and the papers from which the data were taken are in the Zip folder:

[Morocco_Siberia](https://github.com/StratoBayes/workshop/blob/fb6b16bc1bc7f081cb015b526d658d5edad196e4/files/Morocco_Siberia.zip)

Some approaches you could try:

-   Start by correlating just two sections on the height scale

-   You could also start with correlating just some parts of sections, discarding the rest of the data

-   Simplify the lithology data - does it make sense to assume that the same lithology at the bottom and top of a long section had the same sedimentation rate, or do you want to split the data differently?

-   Are there any unconformities? For example, add a gap at the sequence boundary between the Sukharika and Krasnoporog formations in the Siberian section

-   Try a correlation on the age scale, using the radiometric ages

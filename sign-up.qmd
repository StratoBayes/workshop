In preparation for the workshop, it would be helpful to install a recent version of **R** (<https://www.r-project.org/>) and **Rstudio** ([RStudio Desktop - Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)). Typing the following command into the R console will install the packages necessary to run StratoBayes on day 2:

``` r
install.packages(c("cli", "coda", "doParallel", "EnvStats", "fda",
                   "foreach", "dbscan", "mcmcse", "msm", "mvnfast",
                   "protoclust", "Rcpp", "Rdpack", "Rfast"))
```

Stratigraphic correlation and age modelling are fundamental for understanding Earth history, the evolution of life and climate, as well as for the extraction of subsurface resources. We have developed an R package that takes a Bayesian approach to correlating and dating geological data. It automatically aligns geochemical or geophysical signals measured in multiple outcrops or wells, and is able to integrate absolute age constraints such as radiometric dates, providing age-depth models with realistic uncertainty estimates. In this workshop, participants will learn the use of the StratoBayes R package, and are encouraged to build stratigraphic correlations or age models using their own data sets. The workshop includes an optional introduction to R on day one, followed by two days of working with stratigraphic data."
